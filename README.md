# P.A.S. Fork v. 1.5
<details>
  <summary>Preamble</summary>
<br/>
  
>For improvements was chosen a ready-made and well-tested webshell with a GUI interface.
**WSO2** is obsolete and requires significant improvements. **b374k** is too overloaded with unnecessary functionality. **P.A.S.**, with its structure and design, fit perfectly.
Although the author stopped supporting his product, I did not dare to release a modification with a further version number (the cobbler should stick to his last). Therefore, I offer my respect to @profexer, and I hope that he will continue his wonderful work someday.

A modified version of the well-known webshell - P.A.S. by Profexer ([0](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/blowing-the-whistle-on-bad-attribution/), [1](https://github.com/winstrool/pas-4.1.1b_source_code), [2](https://github.com/wordfence/grizzly/tree/master/pas-4.1.1b)). Tries to solve the problem of detecting some requests and responses by various **Web Application Firewalls** and **Intrusion Detection Systems**. In most cases, such detections entail retaliatory measures from the attacked side, which is not always permissible during penetration tests and in red teaming.

Troubleshooting
===============
**The script doesn't work and keeps returning the same response.**
* Perhaps caching of GET requests is enabled on the server. The solution is to turn off params passing via cookies and use POST requests (`$GLOBALS['COOKIE'] = false;`).

**The randomly repeated password prompts.**
* Most likely, your IP address changes with the same frequency. If so, then you need to change `$GLOBALS['REMOTE_ADDR']` to `false`.

**Large files not downloading.**
* The file wrapping operation happens on the fly, so a lot of RAM is required. The solution is to disable obfuscation by checking the `Skip response encoding` option in script GUI settings.

**How to remove the warning about the limit of request?**
* You should disable data transmission via cookies in the GUI (`Use cookie to request`). Or thus: `$GLOBALS['COOKIE'] = false;`.

**How set an authorization by the header?**
* `$GLOBALS['SECHEAD'] = 'SECRET_9CA2100C44E50D81BB7E3EED84AF43F4';` and append it for each request in your browser (`Secret-9ca2100c44e50d81bb7e3eed84af43f4: foobar`). Without password asking - `$GLOBALS['PASSHASH'] = '';`

**Switching the color theme is annoying.**
* `$GLOBALS['DARK'] = true;`

**How to configure the code editor?**
* You can place the editor [source code](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) on your host and specify `URL`. `MODE` and `THEME` is used to set default values during editor initialization. To exclude the editor completely, set the `$GLOBALS['ACECONF']` variable to `array()`. Set `DEFAULT` to `true` if you want to load the editor automatically.

**UI elements are too small.**
* **Ctrl** and **+** for zoom / **Ctrl** and **-** for zoom out / **Ctrl** + **0** for reset

**How to remove the password prompt?**
* `$GLOBALS['PASSHASH'] = '';`

**How to change the default tab?**
* You have 5 options: `tabFM`, `tabSQL`, `tabPHP`, `tabTrm`, `tabInf`. For example: `$GLOBALS['DEFAULT_TAB'] = 'tabFM';`, to start script from the **File Manager** tab. 

**`Send as` and `Load as` encodings don't work.**
* Currently, for functionality, you should disable request and response obfuscation in the GUI.
<br/>

Packer
============
**Usage:**

* `php packer.php pas_fork.php PHAR CM`
  
**Modes:**

* **ASCII** // `eval` 
* **ASCII CF** // `create_function`, PHP5/7 only
* **PHAR** // `include` + phar:// + PHAR container
* **PHAR CM** // the same compressed
* **ZIP** // `include` + phar:// + ZIP container
* **ZIP CM** // the same compressed ( *the output isn't always valid for PHP5/7, try to pack several times* )

The **php-zip** extension is not required for the packaged script to work on target host.
